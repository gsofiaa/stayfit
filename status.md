Short answers to the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

The bot is actually asking the first part of questions (such as weight, height, age) and offers an option to choose the language (between Russian and English)

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We still didn't invent the choice of meals and we are still deciding how we can do it. We want the bot to offer some meals depending on the calories needed and the kitchen the user prefers.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

To be honest, the main problem that we face is that we're not sure how to properly divide activity, or how to implement food options in it's best way. There are lots of opportunities of how to do that but due to the small amount of time we have we're not sure that we can implement everything we want.
