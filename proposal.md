# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Stay Fit

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

This is a chatbot that offers all sorts of recommendations on the calories that are needed depending on a person's goal.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Overall, this project relies on Python. Chatbot will be based on messenger Telegram and will be designed with buttons and a simple interface which makes communication very easy and understandable for a person. The user can input several body indicators related to a person's lifestyle, food preferences, and goals that the user wants to achieve. It also includes ai so recommendations are very flexible and the chatbot will adjust recommendations to the specific person's needs.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable -- not applicable. 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Yes, I'm doing this project with sofia gribkova.


## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

After Zoom proposal approval I decided to concentrate on what Professor Rosen advised me - no matter what, I would create a chatbot that would work without errors.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I would create a chatbot that will calculate the necessary amount of calories needed for a person's goals.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The ideal scenario if I would create a chatbot that would offer specific and personalized recommendations depending on a person's preferences and needs.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I would learn how to create a chatbot and I will finally learn how to do a program on the platform that I personally use and this chatbot can be useful for other people. Before, on all of my projects in this class (except Irma) I was not satisfied because I wanted to create something visually and from the UX perspective very comfortable in using.
